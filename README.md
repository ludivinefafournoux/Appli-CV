macha is a CV project for the Mobiles Technologies course that occurs at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, in the french riviera.

34 students attend this course.

This courses will start with the trend in mobile (statistics in world about mobile user and mobile application), 
followed by the constraint in mobile development (cost, benefit & time), 
and finish on development solutions.

The aim of this courses is to use as much as possible tools that are seen in other courses (IHM, project management, english, communication, native development, data base, etc.).

The common thread of all the seances is a cv project. Here is mine.
